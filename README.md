# Thank you for coming Qsitory project!

## What is going this project

*This project operates a new programming language Qsitory!*

*you can get an interpreter about Qsitory and use it as a programing language*

## Why is Qsitory benefit

*Qsitory has a few features like other languages do not have.*

### multidimensional 'enhanced roop statement'

*It is like Java's 'enhanced roop statement' and Python's 'for statement'.
'Enhanced roop statement' is taking an element from a list and putting it in a variable and repeating. but also Qsitory enabled multiple lists.so you can eliminate the need to write many similar 'for statement'!*

### dynamic structure

*Generally, the structure has unchanging after definition. But, Qsitory enabled change structure's field at any time. so whenever you be forced to add a field in the structure through an update you may not need to modify every part of this structure involved in the code.*
